# Tools to Remember
This repo reflects what I view as a good set of algorithms to be aware of
for C++ interviews. There is a subset of the code here that should be second nature,
e.g.:

- binary search
- quicksort
- tree printing
- graph and tree traversal
- cycles in graphs
- topological sort

Additionally, combinations, permutations, and partitions are good to know.

Some of this code is adapted from Robert Sedgewick's work, some from a handful of
other sources, and some is my own original work. All of it has been modified by
me, either to clean it up, or to port it from another language to C++.

Please note - this project is a work in progress and will be cleaned up and tested over time.
